You can login as an admin by pressing "login" then entering "admin" as both the username and password.
You can then go to the 'Employees' page to see a list of all users and their logins. There you can create a new user to test normal employee login and functionality.

Once logged in as a different employee, the 'Edit Proflie' page will let you change your login info. You can also view the list of surveys as an employee or admin. In this list, you can search for a specific survey entry by using the search bar or other filters. You can edit or delete a specific entry by pushing the respective button.

To create a survey, logout and there will be a button on your initial landing page. It will take you to the survey form.
